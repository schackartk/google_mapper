# my_google_maps
A script to visualize my Google Maps ratings.

# Preparatory Steps

## Download Your Data
Download your archive from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).

More information on how to do this can be found [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en).

For this script, you will need to select "Maps (your places)". You can download others, but this is the one that will be used.


## Edit file structure
In the same folder where you will clone this repository, extract your Google Archive.

When extracting from a .zip file, depending on your operating system, you may have an overly nested file system. 

Ensure that in your folder (where you will clone this repositry) you have a folder called "Takeout".
